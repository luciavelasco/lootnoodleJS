# LootNoodle
LootNoodle is a javascript file used with roll20's API functionality to allow the loot table to be rolled in game.
This contains all magical items from the Dungeon Master's Guide, Xanathar's Guide to Everything, and Tasha's Cauldron of Everything. This only rolls the Hoard Table as shown in the DMG, but adds the Xanathar and Tasha's items to the item tables. The trinket's are converted to their gold values and the only currency provided is gold.

The command: "!loot [challenge rating of treasure hoard]"
Example: !loot 3

To use the script, simply copy the entire contents of the file (yes the entire thing) and paste it into a new roll20 script tab named 'lootnoodle'.
